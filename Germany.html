    <h1>About Germany</h1>
    <p>Germany is an amazing scenic country to visit that is known for its architecture on buildings, bridges and castles.  Germany also takes part in many festivals.  An example is the DFB Pokal in Berlin, which is a soccer tournament equivalent to the Superbowl.  During this event German teams battle against each other.= to win.  There is also the Berlinale in Berlin which is the largest international film festival held each year.  There are plenty of fun activities to do in Germany but my favorite has to be visiting family friends.  </p>

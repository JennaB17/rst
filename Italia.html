    <h1>About Italy</h1>
    <p>Italy is located in the south of Europe near the Mediterranian sea.  Italy has so many scenic routes, cliffs and landscapes overlooking the ocean and some villages.  This country is shaped like a boot.  When visiting Italy, you will learn so many different traditions and their culture, such as the food and music.  Italian food is loved all over the world.  Some examples are pizza, pasta and cannolis.  Family is one of the most important values for Italians and that is why Italians usually have big family gatherings.  I am Italian and every year when I visit Italy, I always go to the region of Calabria to visit my family.  Also, for thoes who want to live in Italy, citizens get at least four weeks of paid vacation, paid holidays and they are paid double in december because social connections are more important than companies gaining more money. </p>
